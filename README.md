# **Hospital Analysis Project**

This project focuses on analyzing hospital and patient-related data using **R programming**. It demonstrates data cleaning, transformation, and visualization techniques for deriving useful insights from healthcare datasets.

---

## 📂 **Project Structure**

* **`hospital_analysis.R`** – Main R script used for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
* **`patients.csv`** – Sample dataset containing patient information and attributes used in the analysis.
* **`.RData`** – Workspace file storing R objects created during analysis.
* **`.Rhistory`** – History of commands executed in the R environment.

---

## ⚙️ **Features & Analysis**

* Data loading and cleaning of patient records.
* Statistical summaries and trend analysis.
* Visualization of patient-related metrics (age distribution, treatment patterns, efficiency, etc.).
* Insights that can support **healthcare management decisions**.

---

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**

* **R Programming**
* **tidyverse / dplyr** (data manipulation)
* **ggplot2** (data visualization)

## 🚀 **How to Run**

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hospital-analysis.git
   ```
2. Open **`hospital_analysis.R`** in RStudio.
3. Run the script to load `patients.csv` and generate analysis/visualizations.

---

## 📊 **Sample Insights**

* Patient demographics and visit patterns.
* Treatment efficiency and outcomes.
* Visual representation of trends for better decision-making.
